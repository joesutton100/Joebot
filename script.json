    "BEGIN": "Cool, let's start! Just a heads-up: I only respond to specific keywords. You're probably most interested in Joe's CAREER or EDUCATION. You can also ask about his POETRY, or for the LATEST news. You'll encounter more options as we chat!",
    "CAREER": "Joe has about 6 years of experience writing for the web. With excellent communication and writing skills, he loves to research topics big and small and present them in a way that any reader can understand. He's written for BLOGS and PRINT, written MARKETING materials, and does some PROOFREADING work as well. Interested in his POETRY? Just ask!",
    "BLOGS": "Joe began his freelance career blogging for BROOKLYN EXPOSED, for whom he covered local events. He's a current contributor at INDIEREADER, where he regularly features self-published authors and their books. While studying at PRATT, Joe took an internship at the Ground Magazine where he blogged about ART.",
    "BROOKLYN EXPOSED": "Brooklyn Exposed was a website focused on keeping people in-the-know about what was going on in the city's best borough. Joe covered local events, but his niche was in showcasing ART shows and reviews. Wanna know Joe's FAVORITE thing he covered for the site?",
    "FAVORITE": "Joe had a lot of privileged opportunities while working with Brooklyn Exposed, but he says the coolest moment was when he visited Danny Simmons. The neo-African abstract expressionist painter--brother of Russell Simmons and Rev Run--has a beautiful home filled with traditional African art in Crown Heights. Joe was taken aback by the stunning collection!",
    "INDIEREADER": "Joe has been a columnist at IndieReader since August 2014. He regularly features books and authors there, usually centered around a common theme--for example, a monthly roundup of great Kickstarter publishing projects. Ask me what he loves about INDIE LIT, or check out his IndieReader page here for recent posts>> http://bit.ly/1SwJIJL",
    "INDIE LIT": "As a reader and writer, Joe thinks our current renaissance for indie literature is amazing! Thanks to the internet and new platforms for self-publishing, new and marginalized voices are able to get noticed and build communities around their work and experiences. Joe loves being able to shine a light on diverse authors at IndieReader, and doesn't take that responsibility lightly. An indie writer himself, his POETRY is self-published online for anyone to read as well.",
    "PRATT": "Joe studied at Pratt in Brooklyn, NEW YORK from 2009-2013, receiving his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Writing for Publication, Performance & Media. He chose to study at an ART school because he's loved art just as long as he's had an interest in writing, and wanted to surround himself with a creative community. Want to know something AWKWARD about being a writing student at an art school?",
    "AWKWARD": "Because Joe loved to draw, he took a figure drawing class in his junior year. It was difficult to register for a visual arts class due to red tape--and once he was in the class, Joe felt like a fish out of water! But despite being super self-conscious and making some less-than-dazzling drawings, his classmates were very supportive and seemed to think his enthusiasm was cute. Joe still loves to doodle today!",
    "ART": "Joe got his freelancing start by writing event listings for art shows while at BROOKLYN EXPOSED. Eventually he began covering gallery show openings, and as an intern at the Ground Magazine Joe wrote weekly reviews on shows in the city. This is his absolute most favorite exhibit he covered, K-narf's work of art inspired by cannibalism>> http://bit.ly/1Wg4NuF",
